:trollface: Filter stuff on facebook that you don't want to see.

#### :wrench: Install

[From Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/filter/ongmpdiioadbiooegapnhbfglmaacpcd) or clone this repository and load the extension yourself.

#### :point_up: Why?!

Especially useful when a trending topic is spreading and you can't seem to roll your eyes back to where they used to be whenever you saw someone talking about it. Filter those stories by strings: "Heat", "Miami", "2013 Championship" :unamused: (regex based.)
